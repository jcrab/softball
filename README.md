Create a simple PHP database application.  Secure database access with a login form.  Finally, allow new users to register and use your app.

Create the database using the DDL provided.

Users cannot access the games page until their credentials are validated using the users table in the database.

Allow new user registration:

- Provide a new user form with support for a username and two passwords.
- Make sure that the two passwords match.
- Make sure the username is not already in the database.
- Insert a new row with the new credentials (test with plaintext first).
- Hash the password before insertion.

Finally, select game data from the games table.
- Display the data using an HTML table (see w3schools.com).

Test the final application.
